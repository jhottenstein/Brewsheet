From "Designing Great Beers":
The Recipe Formulation Process:
1. Identify and characterize the beer you want to make.
2. Determine malt and extract bill.
3. Determine water quantity and chemistry
4. Determine hop bill.
5. Select yeast and fermentation plan.
6. Ascertain finishing issues, including clarification and carbonation.

That is what this brewsheet should assist with.


MMFs
= Calculate Hop Bill
- Calculate Malt Bill

Stories
= Capture Hop prerequisites
= Calculate bittering hop additions
= Allow one flavor hop addition
  = Create table row
  = Calculate ibus
  = Adjust bittering hop needed
= Allow multiple flavor hops
  = Create table rows
  = Calculate ibus
  = Adjust bittering hop needed
  = create e2e runner
  = Remove default bittering hop
  = Calculate Utilization from boil time
  = Allow removal of flavor hops
= Capture hop bill
  = Create hop storage service
  = Save hopBill to localStorage
  = Reconstruct a hopBill from the json

Nice to Haves
  = Refactor hopBill
  - Make hop fields required before submit
  - Tab order, arrow keys
