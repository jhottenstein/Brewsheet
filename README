From "Designing Great Beers":
The Recipe Formulation Process:
1. Identify and characterize the beer you want to make.
2. Determine malt and extract bill.
3. Determine water quantity and chemistry
4. Determine hop bill.
5. Select yeast and fermentation plan.
6. Ascertain finishing issues, including clarification and carbonation.

That is what this brewsheet should assist with.
